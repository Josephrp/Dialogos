## 1.6 Preparing the Unity Scene
A Unity scene is where you design your game or simulation's environment. It's essential to set up the scene correctly for training your agents.

### 1.6.1 Scene Creation
- Navigate to the Unity Editor.
- Create a new scene dedicated to the LLM.

### 1.6.2 Scene Configuration
- Ensure the scene includes all necessary objects and configurations for agent training.
- Set up lighting, physics, and any other components that will interact with your agents.

## 1.7 Creating Agents
Agents are entities within your environment that will learn and perform tasks.

### 1.7.1 Agent Prefabs
- Access the Unity Hierarchy window.
- Instantiate new agent prefabs in the scene.

### 1.7.2 Agent Design
- Design agents with capabilities to perceive the environment and seek rewards.
- Attach sensors and actuators to the agents.

## 1.8 Writing Configuration Files
Configuration files define the training parameters for your agents.

### 1.8.1 trainer_config.yaml
- Create a `trainer_config.yaml` file in your project directory.
- Define hyperparameters such as batch size, buffer size, and learning rate.

### 1.8.2 Python Environment
- Set up a Python environment to work with the ML-Agents toolkit.
- Use the `mlagents-learn` command to initiate training.

## 1.9 Summary
By the end of this chapter, you should have a fully prepared environment within Unity, ready for the development and training of your Dialogos LLM agents. The next chapter will delve into the design and interaction of these agents, setting the stage for their learning journey.
