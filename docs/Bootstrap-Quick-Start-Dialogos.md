# Dialogos Project Bootstrap Guide

Welcome to the Dialogos Project Bootstrap Guide. This document outlines the sequence of operations performed during the bootstrap process of our Unity application.

## Bootstrap Operations

The `bootstrap.unityboot` file contains a list of commands that are executed sequentially to initialize and prepare the system for operation. Below is a description of each command:

- **InitializeSystem**: Sets up the core systems of the application, including services, configurations, and runtime environments necessary for proper functionality.

- **LoadEntityData**: Populates game or application entities with data. This involves loading data from various sources to prepare entities such as characters, objects, or items within the game world.

- **StartAsyncJobs**: Initiates asynchronous operations that run in parallel with the main thread. These jobs are crucial for performing resource-intensive tasks without causing delays or freezes in the main application flow.

- **ExecuteStaticFunctionCalls**: Performs a series of predefined static function calls. Static functions are methods that do not require an instance of a class to be executed and are typically used for application-wide operations.

## File Location

The `bootstrap.unityboot` file should be placed in a directory that is accessible during runtime. For files that need to be read and potentially modified during runtime, the `Application.persistentDataPath` is recommended. This path is unique to each user and application, ensuring that runtime data persists between sessions.

## File Creation

If the `bootstrap.unityboot` file does not exist within the `Application.persistentDataPath`, it will be created with default content. This ensures that the application can always perform its initialization routine, even if the file was previously missing.

## Conclusion

The bootstrap process is an essential part of the Dialogos Project, ensuring that all systems and entities are correctly initialized and ready for operation. By following the commands outlined in the `bootstrap.unityboot` file, we can maintain a consistent and efficient startup procedure.
