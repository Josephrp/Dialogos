## 1. Introduction
Welcome to the Test Plan for the Dialogos Project. This document serves as the cornerstone of our quality assurance strategy, outlining the systematic approach we will take to validate the functionality, performance, and reliability of our SocraticAgent and Lexer classes. Our commitment to excellence is reflected in our rigorous testing methodology, which not only ensures that our components meet the specified requirements but also excel in real-world scenarios.

As part of our comprehensive testing regime, we will conduct a series of benchmarks to compare the efficiency and effectiveness of our custom Lexer against the renowned Hugging Face transformer. These benchmarks are designed to provide empirical data on the speed, memory usage, and the quality of context representation, enabling us to make informed decisions about the tools and techniques we employ.

Through this test plan, we aim to establish a clear and structured framework for all testing activities, ensuring consistency, transparency, and accountability at every stage of the process.
