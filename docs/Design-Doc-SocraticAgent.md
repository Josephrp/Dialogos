# SocraticAgent Design Document

## Overview
This document describes the design of the SocraticAgent, a sophisticated AI system for a game environment that utilizes a parallel processing architecture. Each state within the agent, known as a ParallelState, operates independently and concurrently, allowing for a dynamic and responsive AI that can adapt to complex scenarios in real-time.

## System Architecture
- **ParallelStates**: The core of the agent's architecture, where each state is an independent process capable of being activated or deactivated based on its action potential.
- **StateProperties**: Individual properties and context for each ParallelState, enabling localized decision-making and actions without direct interference from other states.
- **SessionProperties**: A set of properties that can be shared across ParallelStates, allowing for coordinated actions and information exchange without concurrency issues.
- **Action Potential**: A dynamic value associated with each ParallelState that determines its activation, ensuring the agent can adapt its focus and resources as needed.

## Agent States

The SocraticAgent's functionality is encapsulated within a Parallel State Machine, where each state operates independently and concurrently. The states are activated based on their respective action potentials, allowing the agent to adaptively manage its focus and resources. The states, in their operational sequence, are as follows:

1. **Observe**: Gathers environmental data for informed decision-making.
2. **Orient**: Analyzes the data to understand the situation and identify key elements.
3. **Decide**: Determines the best course of action based on the analysis.
4. **Act**: Executes the chosen actions to influence the game environment.
5. **Learn**: Reviews outcomes to refine strategies and improve future performance.

Each state is designed to function autonomously, with its own set of StateProperties, while also being capable of referencing shared SessionProperties. This structure ensures that the agent can process multiple streams of information and actions simultaneously, adapting to the game environment in real-time.

### Agent States Overview

The SocraticAgent's Parallel State Machine is composed of five distinct states, each with a specific role in the agent's interaction with the game environment. These states are designed to work both independently and collaboratively, ensuring a comprehensive and adaptive AI system.

| State  | Purpose | Reward Handling |
|--------|---------|-----------------|
| Observe | The Observe state is responsible for gathering data from the environment. It serves as the agent's sensory input, collecting information that will inform subsequent states. | Rewards in this state are given for the timely and accurate collection of relevant data. The agent is incentivized to focus on significant changes or events that require attention. |
| Orient | In the Orient state, the agent analyzes the data collected during the Observe state. It contextualizes the information to understand the current situation and identify potential opportunities or threats. | The agent receives rewards for successful identification of actionable insights and patterns within the data. The complexity and accuracy of the analysis are key factors in the reward mechanism. |
| Decide | The Decide state is where the agent selects the most appropriate course of action based on the analysis provided by the Orient state. It involves weighing options and predicting outcomes. | Decision-making is rewarded based on the quality and effectiveness of the chosen actions. Decisions that lead to positive outcomes yield higher rewards, encouraging the agent to make sound choices. |
| Act | The Act state is the execution phase where the agent carries out the actions determined in the Decide state. This state directly affects the game environment. | Execution is rewarded for both the precision of the actions and their impact on the environment. Successful actions that contribute to achieving the agent's goals are highly rewarded. |
| Learn | The Learn state is a reflective phase where the agent assesses the outcomes of its actions and adapts its strategies accordingly. It is crucial for the agent's long-term improvement and adaptability. | Learning is rewarded based on the agent's ability to improve its performance over time. The agent is encouraged to develop new strategies and avoid repeating ineffective behaviors. |

## Parallel State Machine Overview

The **Parallel State Machine** is a pivotal element of the SocraticAgent's framework, facilitating the simultaneous operation of multiple states. This structure is essential for the agent's advanced functionality within game environments, enabling it to handle intricate tasks and make decisions autonomously and precisely.

### Functionality and Dynamics
- **Dynamic State Activation**: States, termed ParallelStates, are activated based on their action potential, a dynamic metric influenced by the current context and environmental conditions.
- **Concurrent Execution**: These states operate in parallel, each in its own process, ensuring multitasking capabilities and swift adaptation to environmental changes.
- **StateProperties and SessionProperties**: Each state has unique StateProperties guiding its behavior, while SessionProperties are shared across states for coordinated action without concurrency issues.
- **Immutable Vector Spaces**: The machine's design prevents simultaneous creation of identical state types, yet allows all states to run concurrently as distinct instances.

### Signal Propagation and Reward System
- **Membrane Dynamics**: Action potentials are akin to signals traversing a membrane, with the membrane's properties affecting signal behaviorâ€”mirroring the agent's action potential dynamics.
- **Action Potential Calculation**: The calculation reflects these dynamics, keeping the Observe state alert and transitioning to idle after inactivity.
- **Optimal State Processing**: Reward signals are structured to direct the agent through state processing in an optimal sequence for maximum reward.
- **Atomic Jobs and Events**: Tasks are atomic events, with the Observe state initiating the signal cascade and engaging other states as necessary.

## Enhanced Multitasking and Concurrency

The SocraticAgent's architecture is bolstered by an advanced multitasking framework that integrates a **Parallel State Machine** with a robust **Thread Processor** and **Job System**. This system is designed to manage and schedule complex concurrent tasks within the game engine and its subsystems, ensuring high efficiency and responsiveness.

### Thread Processor and Job System
- **Threads**: At the core of our system are Threads, which represent individual tasks that can be scheduled and executed on one of the machine's cores. These threads utilize semaphores to manage access to shared resources, preventing conflicts and ensuring smooth operation.
- **Fibers**: A Fiber is a cohesive group of Threads that work in tandem to achieve a specific goal. Fibers allow for a more granular control of task execution, enabling the system to handle intricate and interdependent processes with ease.

### Integration with Parallel State Machine
- **Concurrent FSMs**: The system employs multiple Finite State Machines (FSMs) that operate concurrently, each responsible for managing different facets of the agent's behavior within the game environment.
- **State Synchronization**: A central StateChart oversees the synchronization of states across individual FSMs, ensuring that the agent's actions are coherent and contextually appropriate.
- **Dynamic FSM Management**: An intelligent membrane layer dynamically oversees the FSMs, spawning new ones to accommodate emerging behaviors and pruning those that consistently result in negative outcomes.

### Task Scheduling and Execution
- **Task Prioritization**: The Thread Processor evaluates and prioritizes tasks based on their urgency and relevance, assigning them to Threads within appropriate Fibers.
- **Semaphore Coordination**: Semaphores are employed to orchestrate the execution of tasks, preventing race conditions and ensuring that critical sections of code are accessed in a controlled manner.
- **Efficient Resource Allocation**: The Job System intelligently allocates resources, ensuring that each Thread and Fiber has the necessary computational power to perform optimally without wastage.

By intertwining Threads and Fibers with the existing Parallel State Machine, the SocraticAgent achieves a new level of multitasking capability. This design not only enhances the agent's ability to process multiple streams of information but also fortifies its capacity to execute complex, concurrent tasks within the dynamic and demanding context of game environments.

## Optimized Reward Signal Framework

The SocraticAgent's performance is driven by an optimized reward signal framework that ensures adaptive and goal-oriented behavior.

### Adaptive Action Potential
- **Dynamic Triggers**: The agent's states are influenced by an adaptive action potential, a variable metric that prompts state transitions when it surpasses dynamic thresholds.
- **Contextual Thresholds**: These thresholds are not static; they adjust based on the agent's current context and past experiences, optimizing the timing for state changes.

### Comprehensive Behavior Evaluation
- **Behavioral Analytics**: The enhanced reward system incorporates sophisticated analytics to assess new behaviors, examining their effectiveness and alignment with the agent's objectives.
- **Performance Metrics**: It quantifies the impact of behaviors on the agent's overall performance, using a variety of metrics to ensure a balanced evaluation.

## Overview of PSM Implementation

The implementation of the Parallel State Machine (PSM) is a structured process designed to integrate sophisticated AI capabilities into the game environment. This process ensures that the SocraticAgent can manage multiple tasks concurrently, adapt to new challenges, and learn from its experiences. Below is an organized breakdown of the implementation steps.

### Task Identification and PSM Creation

The first phase involves identifying the tasks the agent will perform and creating dedicated PSMs for each task. These PSMs are equipped with their own states and transitions, tailored to the specific requirements of each task.

### Framework Development and Integration

A central framework is developed to manage all PSMs, featuring systems to track and update the state of each PSM and handle dynamic creation and removal. This framework is then integrated into the game's runtime environment, establishing communication channels for data exchange between the PSMs and game systems.

### Testing, Iteration, and Dynamic Management

Rigorous testing and iteration are conducted to ensure correct state transitions and actions. A membrane layer is implemented for dynamic PSM management, overseeing the performance of PSMs and facilitating the creation of new PSMs for emerging behaviors or tasks, as well as the removal of underperforming PSMs.

### Synchronization, Concurrency, and Reward Optimization

Synchronization mechanisms are designed to ensure PSMs operate in harmony without conflicts, and concurrency is optimized for efficiency. The reward system and behavior evaluation are refined to reinforce beneficial behaviors and assess their impact on the agent's overall goals.

### Final Integration and Comprehensive Testing

The final phase involves a full integration test of the PSM framework within the game environment, stress tests to evaluate performance under various scenarios, and final adjustments based on comprehensive testing results and user feedback.
