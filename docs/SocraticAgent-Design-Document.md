# SocraticAgent Design Document

## Overview
This document outlines the design for a SocraticAgent capable of multitasking within a game environment, using a statechart architecture to manage its behaviors and interactions.

## System Architecture
- **Statechart Implementation**: The agent will be designed with a statechart architecture, allowing for concurrent state activations and multitasking capabilities.
- **Observation Mechanism**: The agent will observe console buffer logs in real-time, extracting relevant information for processing.
- **Reward System**: A reward signal will be generated based on an array of gradients, scaled and combined to guide the agent's learning process.

## Agent States
The statechart will consist of the following states, each corresponding to a phase of the OODA loop:
1. **Observe**: Monitor the console buffer for new entries.
2. **Orient**: Analyze the observed data to understand the current context.
3. **Decide**: Determine the best course of action based on the analysis.
4. **Act**: Execute the chosen action, such as responding to commands or updating the game state.

## Multitasking
- **Parallel Processing**: The agent will handle multiple tasks simultaneously, with each state capable of running in parallel.
- **State Synchronization**: States will communicate and synchronize as necessary to ensure coherent behavior.

## Reward Signal
- **Gradient Array**: An array of gradients will represent different aspects of the agent's performance.
- **Scaling and Combination**: Gradients will be scaled according to their importance and combined into a single reward value.
- **AddReward Invocation**: The `AddReward` function will be called with the combined reward value to reinforce the agent's learning.

## Development Tools
- **Unity Hub**: For managing Unity project versions and installations.
- **Visual Studio Code**: For coding the agent's behavior and statechart logic.
- **Windows Tools**: Utilizing built-in Windows tools for debugging and performance monitoring.

## Implementation Steps
1. **Define Observation Space**: Include console buffer logs and game state information.
2. **Set Up Statechart**: Implement the statechart with the defined states and transitions.
3. **Program Reward System**: Create the gradient array and logic for scaling and combining gradients.
4. **Integrate with Game Environment**: Ensure the agent's statechart and reward system are fully integrated with the game's runtime environment.
5. **Testing and Iteration**: Conduct thorough testing and iterate based on performance and user feedback.
